A libp2p connection is a communication channel that allows two peers to read 
and write data to each other. Peers can connect through transport 
protocols. Transport protocols are core abstractions of libp2p and offer 
extensibility. As a modular networking stack, libp2p is transport-agnostic 
and does not enforce the implementation of a specific transport protocol. 
Though the support of modern transport protocols is a primary focus for 
libp2p, implementers may choose to support multiple types of transport. Learn 
more about transport protocols in libp2p on the 
[transport guide]((/concepts/transports/)). 

Let's first outline key terminology to help us understand connections in libp2p.

## Core libp2p components

- **Peer**: a participant in a libp2p network.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: a distributed network in which workloads are 
  shared between *Peers*.
- **Connection**: a network layer connection between two peers in a libp2p 
  network.
- **Initiator**: a peer that initiates a connection through a dial request.
- **Responder**: a peer that listens to dial requests.
- **Transport**: a mechanism of communication that creates a *Connection*, 
  e.g., TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, etc.
- **Stream**: an abstraction on top of a *Connection* representing a bidirectional 
  communication channel between two *Peers*.
- **Multiplexer**: a mechanism that manages multiple streams and ensures parallel 
  messages reach the correct *Stream*, based on stream identification.
- **Secure channel**: establishes a secure, encrypted, and authenticated channel 
  over a *Connection*.
- **Upgrader**: a mechanism that takes a *Connection* returned by a *Transport*, 
  and performs protocol negotiation to set up a secure, multiplexed channel on 
  top of which *Streams* can be opened.

## Opening a libp2p connection

A libp2p connection only requires two core operations: dialing and listening. 
Both operations exist as interfaces in libp2p, where a transport protocol is used 
to expose the dialing and listening interfaces. The listening interface allows a 
peer to listen to connection requests from others, while the dialing interface 
allows a peer to send connection requests to a listening peer. Most of the connection 
initation process is abstracted through libp2p's interfaces.

### How do peers prevent multiple connections from being established? 

An interface called a [switch](/concepts/stream-multiplexing/#switch/swarm) 
(and sometimes swarm) implements a basic dial queue that manages an application's 
dialing and listening state. This prevents multiple, 
simultaneous dial requests to the same peer. Peers will generally dial other
peers using the switch interface, which initiates a stream to read from and write 
to. The switch will find the appropriate transport protocol to open a connection. 

### How do peers know what transports other peers support?

A data store known as a Peer Store in libp2p holds an updated data registry of 
all known peers and their Peer Info. Other peers can dial the Peer Store, listen 
for updates, and learn about any peer within the network. More information about peers
is available on the [peers guide](/concepts/peers).

### How do peers establish a connection once they find others to connect to?

A peer sends its multiaddr to the switch when it is ready to connect. 
The dialing peer, known as the *Initiator* of the connection, sends a dialing request 
to the listening peer, known as the *Responder* of the connection, via the Initiator's 
multiaddr over the transport that the switch initiated. To accept connections, a libp2p 
application registers handler functions for  protocols using their protocol ID with the 
switch.

More information on multiaddrs, peers, and protocols is available on the
[addressing](/concepts/addressing), [peers](/concepts/peers),
[protocol](/concepts/protocols) guides, respectively.

### How does the switch decide on which transport protocol to use?

The switch conducts a protocol negotiation process between two peers through an 
interface known as [`multistream-select`](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select).
In particular, the multicodec is negotiated between two peers.

### What happens when two peers do not support the same transport?

If a Responder doesn't support a particular protocol, they may respond with "na" 
(not available), and the Initiator can either try another protocol, request a list 
of supported protocols, or stop sending dialing requests. If there was an existing 
connection made to a remote peer, the switch will simply use the existing connection 
and open another multiplexed stream over it. Stay tuned for a dedicated guide on
protocol negotiation. For now, the 
[protocol negotiation section](/concepts/protocols/protocol-negotiation) in the 
protocol guide outlines the gist of multistream.

Another option is using the [circuit relay](/concepts/circuit-relay) transport 
protocol, which routes network traffic between two peers over a relay peer. 
A peer can advertise itself as being reachable through a remote relay node. 

### How can the Responder dial back to the Initiator?

In general, a peer multiaddr is typically discovered with their Peer ID, which
acts as a unique identifier for each peer in a libp2p network.

If a peer relies on a relay node to listen to a dial request, circuit relaying 
creates a peer-to-peer circuit by adding the connection path to the connection 
multiaddr. Thus, a listening peer can use the same path to dial back to a peer 
that dialed to it.

### What if peers canâ€™t find other peers to dial?

Libp2p offers a discovery mechanism to discover peers on a libp2p network, 
known as peer discovery. Once the network successfully discovers a peer 
multiaddr (and can establish a connection), the peer discovery protocol 
adds the Peer Info and multiaddr to the Peer Store. Stay tuned for a dedicated 
guide on discovering un-{known, identified}. For now, please refer to the
[peers guide](/concepts/peers) for more information.

### How do peers check if other peers are dialable?

Peers can use the AutoNAT interface to check if a peer can be dialed.
Learn about AutoNAT on the [NAT traversal guide](/concepts/nat/#autonat).

### What if a peer is not dialable?

Libp2p includes a decentralized hole punching feature that allows firewall 
and NAT traversal. Learn more about establishing direct connections with non-public
nodes on the [hole punching guide](/concepts/circuit-relay).

## Upgrading a raw libp2p connection

Before two peers can transmit data, the communication channel they established 
with a transport protocol should be secure. Each peer must also be able to open 
multiple independent communication streams over a single channel. A transport 
protocol like QUIC provides these guarantees out-of-the-box, but other transports 
in libp2p do not provide the logic to secure their channel and support 
multiple streams. This requires an upgrade to the transport using an upgrader.

Several security protocols are supported in libp2p for encryption, the two primary 
ones being Noise and TLS 1.3. See the secure channel guide for more information on 
protocol security. Learn more about Noise and TLS 1.3 on the secure channels guide.

Stream multiplexing (or *stream muxing*) is a way of sending and managing multiple 
streams of data over one communication link. The stream muxer combines multiple 
signals into one unified signal and then demultiplexed (*demuxed*) to the correct 
output, distinguished by a unique identifier. Learn more about stream muxing on the 
[stream multiplexing guide](/concepts/stream-multiplexing).

Security is always established first over the raw connection. The negotiation for 
stream multiplexing then takes place over the encrypted channel.

Connections in libp2p are meant to be flexible, allowing communication to be 
future-proof. Connections should evolve as technology evolves, meaning that the 
construct of a libp2p connection can change. An example of this is the now deprecated 
SECIO secure channel protocol. SECIO used to be the default libp2p encryption method 
but has since been phased out and replaced with more modern encryption schemes like 
TLS 1.3.
